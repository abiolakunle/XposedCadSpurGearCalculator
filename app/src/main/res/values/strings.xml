    <string name="title_activity_spur_gear_terms">Spur gear terms</string>
    <string name="term_text">
        1.	PITCH DIAMETER (D) \n
The diameter of the Pitch Circle from which the gear is designed. An imaginary circle, which will contact the pitch circle of another gear when in mesh.
\n\n
2.	DIAMETRAL PITCH (P) \n
A ratio of the number of teeth per inch of pitch diameter.
\n\n

3.	ADDENDUM (A) \n
The radial distance from the pitch circle to the top of the gear tooth.
\n\n

4.	DEDENDUM (B) \n
The radial distance from the pitch circle to the bottom of the tooth.
\n\n

5.	OUTSIDE DIAMETER (OD) \n
The overall diameter of the gear.
\n\n

6.	ROOT DIAMETER (RD) \n
The diameter at the Bottom of the tooth.
\n\n

7.	BASE CIRCLE (BC) \n
The circle used to form the involute section of the gear tooth.
\n\n

8.	CIRCULAR PITCH (CP) \n
The measured distance along the circumference of the Pitch Diameter from the point of one tooth to the corresponding point on an adjacent tooth.
\n\n

9.	CIRCULAR TOOTH THICKNESS (T) \n
Thickness of a tooth measure along the circumference of the Pitch Circle.
\n\n

10.	WHOLE DEPTH (WD) \n
Refers to the distance from the top of the tooth to the bottom of the tooth.
\n\n

11.	PRESSURE ANGLE (PA) \n
It refers to the angle through which forces are transmitted between meshing gears.
\n\n

12.	CLEARANCE (C) \n
Refers to the radial distance between the top and bottom of gears in mesh.
\n\n

13.	CENTER DISTANCE  \n
The center distance of 2 spur gears is the distance from the center shaft of one spur gear to the
center shaft of the other.
\n\n

14.	PITCH POINT  \n
It is the point of contact between the pitch circles of two gears in mesh.
\n\n

15.	LINE OF ACTION  \n
Contact between the teeth of meshing gears take place along a line tangential to the two base circles. This line passes through the pitch point and is called the line of action.
\n\n

16.	WORKING DEPTH  \n
It is the maximum depth that the tooth extends into the tooth space of a mating gear. It is the sum of the addenda of the gears.
\n\n

17.	TOOTH FACE  \n
Is the surface of a tooth above the pitch circle, parallel to the axis of the gear.
\n\n

18.	TOOTH FLANK  \n
Is the tooth surface below the pitch circle, parallel to the axis of the gear.
